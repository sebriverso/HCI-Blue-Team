The AACMS is a tuition-free school, and students do not pay art, equipment, or material fees. Our students want to come to school, and are eager to learn. Here's what our students have to say about the school:" />
                    <ContentText content="&#34;The AACMS makes me feel that school is not a place where I am trapped for seven hours a day. Before I came here I thought school would be a place where I would be mentally harassed for the rest of my life. Now that I am at the AACMS, I feel like I am not the only person who was a singer and actor. I am surrounded by people like me. I am comfortable here. I feel secure and safe. This school has made me more positive.&#34; -Vincent K., 8th grade vocal music student" />
                    <ContentText content="&#34;The AACMS has exposed me to the real world in a great way. I am now making friendships with all kinds of different people. Unlike my old school, the teachers are all very kind, patient and open to new ideas, making me very eager to learn. I used to consider school annoying, boring and an interruption, but the teachers have made it fun. Every teacher has their own special talent. They bring fun to learning and the arts, a perfect balance.&#34; -Katherine C., 6th grade figure skating student" />
                    <ContentText content="&#34;What I like best about the AACMS is how all teachers and staff are all kind and understanding.&#34; -Angel R., 5th grade instrumental music and visual arts student" />
