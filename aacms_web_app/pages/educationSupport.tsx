                The SRSS is conducted to better inform instruction. It is not used to exclude students from the instructional environment. Rather, it is used to select appropriate supports for students."/>
                <ContentText content="The SRSS is not used independently to determine special education eligibility or make other high stakes decisions. The SRSS, like all universal screening tools, is not used to label students. The SRSS is not intended as an assessment of traits or personality. 
                It should be used as one of multiple data sources to indicate student risk."/>
